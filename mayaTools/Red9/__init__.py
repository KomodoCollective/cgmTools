    Red9 StudioPack:
    email : rednineinfo@gmail.com

    This is the main entry point for initilizing the Red9 StudioPack. 
    Unlike previous releases I've removed the ability to install this via the
    Maya Module systems. Instead I've made it more of a standard Python site-package
    which has many benefits in the way the systems are managed.
    Simply running the following will initialize and install the setups
    
    You need to modify the path to point to the folder containing this file and
    add it to the system path UNLESS the Red9 folder is already on a Maya script path.
    
    import sys
    sys.path.append('P:\Red9_Pipeline\Red9_Release1.26')
    
    import Red9
    Red9.start()
