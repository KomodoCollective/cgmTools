Toolbox
********************

The cgmToolbox can be accessed in a couple of different ways:

* **Top menu** - We'll be talking about using this method in the next sections
* **Marking menu** - We'll get to this later or you can LATER

The new top menu was initially released in February 2017. It shares tool libraries with the
marking menu so most items available in one are in the other. Menu sections may be torn off for easy access.

Tool Window
====================
This is quick access to some legacy tools and some settings for the toolbox as as whole.
