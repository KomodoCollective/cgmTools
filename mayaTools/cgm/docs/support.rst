Reporting issues
==================
* Before you start to log a bug, please do the following:
    * Turn on ``Script Editor>History>Show Stack Trace``. It will help you figure out where to start. Make note of any errors on the offending function. See if you can replicate the issue to provide the best bug report as possible
    * We need to know OS, Maya version and any other pertinent info
* Once you have the toolbox installed, you can go ``cgm>help>report>Enviornment Info`` if you're unsure on your data. That report looks like this:
